# REFERENCE FILES FOR TESTS

This document explains the use of the files in this directory, that serve as an input for the tests in the parent 
directory. They are all meant to be both light and representative of the ones used for scientific results.

### - `reference.evt`

### - `reference.pha`

Spectrum file that simulates a *XRISM-Resolve* observation of a Gadget simulated cluster.

### - `reference.simput`

A SIMPUT file containing the data for the emission of a Gadget simulated cluster.

### - `reference.simput`

A Spec-cube file containing the data for the emission of a Gadget simulated cluster.

### - `reference_erosita_pointed.evt`
